# LevelTwoAuthentication
This is a level two authentication. 
To use it install the following npm packages:
ejs express mongoose mongoose-encryption body-parser

Issues with Level 2 Authentication:
The problem with this type of authentication is that if hackers were to hack the website and get
their hands on the encryption secret word, they will be able to decrypt all the passwords of the
website using the same plugins used to encrypt the passwords.
